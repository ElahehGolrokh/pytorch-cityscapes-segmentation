# Cityscapes Semantic Segmentation (PyTorch)

This project implements a complete **semantic segmentation pipeline in PyTorch** using a Cityscapes-style dataset from Kaggle:

**Dataset:**  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshaymahna/cityscapes-depth-and-segmentation/data

The project includes:

- Data preprocessing  
- Class remapping from **19 original classes** to **10 merged classes**
- Model training  
- Evaluation  
- Inference and visualization  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The original dataset provides **19 semantic classes**.  
However, training a segmentation model on all 19 classes produced **poor performance**, mainly due to:

- Severe class imbalance  
- Very small or rare classes  
- Missing classes in many scenes  
- Inconsistent annotation density

To improve results, I analyzed the **pixel distribution of all masks** and merged several rare or similar classes, producing a **10-class mapping**.  
This significantly improved stability and model accuracy.

## 🗺️ Class Mapping (19 → 10 Classes)

Some examples:

- `sidewalk` merged into road-like category  
- `wall`, `fence`, `building` merged into a single “structure” category  
- `traffic_light` + `traffic_sign` merged into “traffic_object”  
- All large vehicles (`truck`, `bus`, `train`) merged into a single “large vehicle” class  
- `bicycle` mapped to background due to 0 frequency

The full mapping dictionary is provided in `config.yaml`.
